# GoDaddy Deployment Fix Guide for Bondly CRM Frontend

## Issue Analysis

Based on your report that the frontend is not working when deployed to GoDaddy, I've identified several potential issues and solutions:

## Common Issues and Fixes

### 1. Missing .htaccess File
The [.htaccess](file:///C:/Users/sathi/OneDrive/Desktop/NextGen_AI/Travels/frontend/public/.htaccess) file is crucial for SPA routing on Apache servers. Make sure it's uploaded to your GoDaddy root directory.

### 2. Incorrect File Structure
When deploying to GoDaddy, all static files should be in the root directory, not in a subfolder.

### 3. Environment Variables Not Set
GoDaddy requires environment variables to be set in the hosting control panel.

## Step-by-Step Fix

### Step 1: Extract and Verify dist.zip
1. Extract the [dist.zip](file:///C:/Users/sathi/OneDrive/Desktop/NextGen_AI/Travels/frontend/dist.zip) file
2. Verify it contains all necessary files including:
   - index.html
   - CSS and JS files
   - [.htaccess](file:///C:/Users/sathi/OneDrive/Desktop/NextGen_AI/Travels/frontend/public/.htaccess)
   - Images and other assets

### Step 2: Check .htaccess File
Ensure your [.htaccess](file:///C:/Users/sathi/OneDrive/Desktop/NextGen_AI/Travels/frontend/public/.htaccess) file has the correct content:
```apache
# Redirect all requests to index.html for SPA routing
RewriteEngine On

# Allow direct access to existing files and directories
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} -f [OR]
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} -d
RewriteRule ^ - [L]

# Redirect all other requests to index.html
RewriteRule ^ index.html [L]

# Security headers
<IfModule mod_headers.c>
  # Prevent MIME type sniffing
  Header always set X-Content-Type-Options "nosniff"
  
  # Prevent clickjacking
  Header always set X-Frame-Options "DENY"
  
  # Enable XSS protection
  Header always set X-XSS-Protection "1; mode=block"
</IfModule>

# Cache control for static files
<IfModule mod_expires.c>
  ExpiresActive On
  ExpiresByType text/css "access plus 1 year"
  ExpiresByType text/javascript "access plus 1 year"
  ExpiresByType application/javascript "access plus 1 year"
  ExpiresByType image/png "access plus 1 year"
  ExpiresByType image/jpg "access plus 1 year"
  ExpiresByType image/jpeg "access plus 1 year"
  ExpiresByType image/gif "access plus 1 year"
  ExpiresByType image/svg+xml "access plus 1 year"
</IfModule>
```

### Step 3: Set Environment Variables in GoDaddy
In your GoDaddy hosting control panel, set these environment variables:
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL`=your_supabase_url
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`=your_supabase_anon_key
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_BACKEND_API_URL`=https://your-backend-url.onrender.com

### Step 4: Upload Files Correctly
1. Extract all files from [dist.zip](file:///C:/Users/sathi/OneDrive/Desktop/NextGen_AI/Travels/frontend/dist.zip)
2. Upload them to your GoDaddy root directory (not in a subfolder)
3. Ensure [.htaccess](file:///C:/Users/sathi/OneDrive/Desktop/NextGen_AI/Travels/frontend/public/.htaccess) is in the root directory

### Step 5: Verify Apache mod_rewrite is Enabled
Contact GoDaddy support to ensure mod_rewrite is enabled on your hosting account.

## Troubleshooting

### If Pages Return 404 Errors
1. Verify [.htaccess](file:///C:/Users/sathi/OneDrive/Desktop/NextGen_AI/Travels/frontend/public/.htaccess) is in the root directory
2. Check that mod_rewrite is enabled
3. Clear your browser cache

### If Backend API Calls Fail
1. Verify environment variables are correctly set
2. Check browser console for CORS errors
3. Ensure your Render backend allows requests from your GoDaddy domain

### If Styling is Broken
1. Check that all CSS files are uploaded
2. Verify file paths in index.html
3. Check browser console for 404 errors on CSS/JS files

## Alternative Solution: Rebuild for GoDaddy

If the current [dist.zip](file:///C:/Users/sathi/OneDrive/Desktop/NextGen_AI/Travels/frontend/dist.zip) doesn't work, you can rebuild using the proper configuration:

1. Navigate to your frontend directory
2. Run `npm run build:godaddy`
3. Upload the contents of `.next/server/app` to your GoDaddy root directory
4. Ensure [.htaccess](file:///C:/Users/sathi/OneDrive/Desktop/NextGen_AI/Travels/frontend/public/.htaccess) is included

## Verification Steps

After deployment, verify:
1. Homepage loads correctly
2. All routes work (e.g., /dashboard, /login)
3. Authentication works
4. API calls to backend function
5. All images and styles load correctly

1. Browser console errors
2. Network tab errors

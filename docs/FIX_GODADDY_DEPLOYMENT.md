# FIX: GoDaddy Frontend Deployment Issue

## Problem Summary
You've uploaded files to GoDaddy but the frontend is not opening. This is a common issue with specific causes and solutions.

## Immediate Solution

### Step 1: Run Verification Script
First, let's check what you currently have:

1. Open PowerShell or terminal
2. Navigate to your frontend directory:
   ```bash
   cd c:\Users\sathi\OneDrive\Desktop\NextGen_AI\Travels\frontend
   ```
3. Run the verification script:
   ```bash
   npm run verify:godaddy
   ```

This will tell you what files you have and if everything is set up correctly.

### Step 2: Check Your dist.zip File
Based on what I can see, you have a [dist.zip](file:///C:/Users/sathi/OneDrive/Desktop/NextGen_AI/Travels/frontend/dist.zip) file (2.9MB). This should contain your built frontend.

### Step 3: Extract and Deploy dist.zip
1. Right-click on [dist.zip](file:///C:/Users/sathi/OneDrive/Desktop/NextGen_AI/Travels/frontend/dist.zip) and select "Extract All"
2. Open the extracted folder
3. You should see files like:
   - `index.html`
   - CSS files
   - JavaScript files
   - [.htaccess](file:///C:/Users/sathi/OneDrive/Desktop/NextGen_AI/Travels/frontend/public/.htaccess)
4. Select ALL files in this folder
5. Upload them to your GoDaddy root directory (public_html or htdocs)

### Step 4: Verify Upload Location
CRITICAL: Make sure you're uploading to the ROOT directory, not a subfolder.

✅ CORRECT: `public_html/` (root directory)
❌ INCORRECT: `public_html/frontend/` (subfolder)

### Step 5: Check .htaccess File
After uploading, verify that [.htaccess](file:///C:/Users/sathi/OneDrive/Desktop/NextGen_AI/Travels/frontend/public/.htaccess) is in the root directory (next to index.html).

### Step 6: Set Environment Variables
In your GoDaddy hosting control panel:
1. Find "Environment Variables" or "Application Settings"
2. Add these three variables:
   - `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL`=https://your-project-id.supabase.co
   - `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`=your_supabase_anon_key
   - `NEXT_PUBLIC_BACKEND_API_URL`=https://bondly-0r0c.onrender.com

## If dist.zip Doesn't Work

If the [dist.zip](file:///C:/Users/sathi/OneDrive/Desktop/NextGen_AI/Travels/frontend/dist.zip) file doesn't work, create a fresh build:

1. Open PowerShell or terminal
2. Navigate to your frontend directory:
   ```bash
   cd c:\Users\sathi\OneDrive\Desktop\NextGen_AI\Travels\frontend
   ```
3. Run the simple build script:
   ```bash
   npm run build:godaddy:simple
   ```
4. This will create files in `.next/server/app`
5. Upload ALL contents of `.next/server/app` to your GoDaddy root directory

## Common Issues and Fixes

### Issue 1: "404 Page Not Found" on All Pages
**Cause**: Missing or incorrect [.htaccess](file:///C:/Users/sathi/OneDrive/Desktop/NextGen_AI/Travels/frontend/public/.htaccess) file
**Fix**: 
1. Re-upload [.htaccess](file:///C:/Users/sathi/OneDrive/Desktop/NextGen_AI/Travels/frontend/public/.htaccess) to root directory
2. Contact GoDaddy to confirm `mod_rewrite` is enabled

### Issue 2: Blank White Page
**Cause**: JavaScript errors or missing assets
**Fix**:
1. Press F12 to open browser developer tools
2. Check the Console tab for errors
3. Check the Network tab for failed file loads

### Issue 3: Login/Authentication Not Working
**Cause**: Environment variables not set
**Fix**: Set the environment variables as described in Step 6 above

## Testing Your Fix

After making changes:
1. Clear your browser cache (Ctrl+Shift+Delete)
2. Try accessing your site in an incognito/private browser window
3. Test these URLs:
   - Your main domain (should show homepage)
   - `/dashboard` (should show dashboard)
   - `/login` (should show login page)

## If You're Still Having Issues

Please provide:
1. Screenshots of your file structure in GoDaddy File Manager
2. Browser console errors (F12 > Console tab)
3. Network tab errors (F12 > Network tab)
4. The exact URL where you're trying to access the site

## Additional Notes

1. The [.htaccess](file:///C:/Users/sathi/OneDrive/Desktop/NextGen_AI/Travels/frontend/public/.htaccess) file is ESSENTIAL for SPA routing to work
2. All files must be in the root directory, not in a subfolder
3. Environment variables must be set in the GoDaddy control panel
4. Make sure `mod_rewrite` is enabled on your GoDaddy hosting (contact support if unsure)

This should resolve your GoDaddy deployment issue. The most common cause is uploading files to a subfolder instead of the root directory, or missing the [.htaccess](file:///C:/Users/sathi/OneDrive/Desktop/NextGen_AI/Travels/frontend/public/.htaccess) file.

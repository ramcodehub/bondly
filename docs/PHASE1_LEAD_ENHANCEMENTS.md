# Phase 1: Lead Enhancements Implementation

This document outlines the implementation of Phase 1 Lead Enhancements for the Bondly system.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Lead Nurturing Workflow

**Database Changes:**
- Created new `lead_nurturing` table with the following schema:
  ```sql
  CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS public.lead_nurturing (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    lead_id INT REFERENCES leads(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    action_type TEXT NOT NULL, -- e.g., 'email', 'call', 'follow-up'
    action_date TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW(),
    notes TEXT,
    status TEXT DEFAULT 'pending'
  );
  ```

**Backend API Routes:**
- `GET /api/extended/leads/:id/nurturing` - Get all nurturing actions for a lead
- `POST /api/extended/leads/:id/nurturing` - Create a new nurturing action for a lead
- `PUT /api/extended/leads/nurturing/:id` - Update a nurturing action

**Frontend Components:**
- Added new "Nurturing" tab to Lead Details page
- Created timeline view for lead interactions
- Added form for creating new nurturing actions

### 2. Lead Scoring

**Database Changes:**
- Added `score` column to `leads` table:
  ```sql
  ALTER TABLE leads ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS score INT DEFAULT 0;
  ```

**Backend Logic:**
- Implemented scoring algorithm:
  - +10 points for each nurturing action
  - Placeholder for future integrations (email opened, opportunity created)

**API Route:**
- `PUT /api/extended/leads/:id/score` - Recalculate lead score

**Frontend Integration:**
- Display score as badge on Leads list
- Display score as badge on Lead Details page

### 3. Lead Source Analytics

**Database Changes:**
- Added `source` column to `leads` table (already existed but updated options)

**Backend API Route:**
- `GET /api/extended/leads/analytics/sources` - Get lead source distribution

**Frontend Components:**
- Added Recharts Pie Chart to Dashboard for Lead Sources Distribution
- Updated lead form with new source options: Website, Referral, Ads, Event, Other

## Implementation Details

### Backend Implementation

1. **Extended Routes**: Created new API routes under `/api/extended/leads` namespace to avoid modifying existing routes
2. **Database Schema**: Added new table and columns with proper indexing for performance
3. **Scoring Logic**: Implemented modular scoring system that can be extended with future integrations

### Frontend Implementation

1. **Zustand Store**: Created dedicated store for lead nurturing actions with persistence
2. **UI Components**: 
   - Added tabbed interface to lead details page
   - Created timeline view for nurturing actions
   - Added pie chart for source analytics
   - Integrated score badges in lists and detail views
3. **Form Updates**: Updated lead forms with new source options

### Integration Points

1. **Dashboard**: Added lead source analytics chart
2. **Leads List**: Added score column with color-coded badges
3. **Lead Details**: Added nurturing tab with timeline view
4. **API Layer**: Extended API with new endpoints under `/extended` namespace

## Testing

All new features have been implemented with:
- Proper error handling
- Loading states
- Type safety (TypeScript)
- Responsive UI components
- Modular and reusable code patterns

## Future Enhancements

The current implementation provides a solid foundation for:
- Email tracking integration (+20 points)
- Opportunity creation scoring (+30 points)
- Advanced nurturing workflows
- More detailed analytics and reporting
